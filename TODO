- new functionnal idea: retrieve personnal mail using gmail python or other tools to retrieve it and regroup job listing propositions
- solve problem with iso99... to utf8 -> abandon libxml++ and glib::ustring -> use only libxml2 with unsigned chars
- ajouter un namespace specifique a chaque lib interne et un ou plusieurs namespaces au code principal (low prio)
- what about html5 -> is it entirely ok to parse it with an xml sax parser?
- on_characters() callback just deals with characters written outside any proper xml tag
- how about parsing javascript...? (using a third party js compiler and hacking its behavior?)

wchar_t dans read_content

- grammar into class hierarchy: how to virtualize this so that we can instantiate one for csv files, and etc...?
- cmake: rule to build static lib, and to be able to compile separately
- boost progress
- yahoo finance daily info day by day and even in the close past -> new parsing system?
- ticks should contain more data: smtg like: "Id|Isin|Name|Exchange|Type|Industry"
- singleton manager classes
- using templated classes or dynamically allocated polymorphic classes from the main, based on the file extension
- building a logger class
- boost spirit multi-thread implicitely? -> if no, use normal
   iterators and use getline(), as in
   http://boost-spirit.com/home/2010/11/07/multi-threaded-qi-6-hours-37-seconds/,
   except for that the results (semantic actions) must be not shared
   during construction and concatained only at the end of parsing ->
   also problem of unordered result...
- parallel computation during process
- setting up tests with ctest/cdash or with boost:

 Using the dashboard scripts
The dashboard branch contains a dashboard client helper script. Use these commands to track it:
    $ mkdir -p ~/Dashboards/CMakeScripts 
    $ cd ~/Dashboards/CMakeScripts 
    $ git init 
    $ git remote add -t dashboard origin git://cmake.org/cmake.git 
    $ git pull origin 
The cmake_common.cmake script contains setup instructions in its top comments. Update the dashboard branch to get the latest version of this script by simply running
    $ git pull origin 

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
>       -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc   \
>       -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ \
>       ../cpp-netlib

- deal with compilation related secondary issues
make -k || mpg123 -k 3000 -n 200 bitter.mp3 ~/Music/samples/bitter.mp3 && mpg123 -k 3000 -n 200 bitter.mp3 ~/Music/samples/buenos.mp3
